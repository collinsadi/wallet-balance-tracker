# Wallet Balance Tracker

A simple React application that connects to Ethereum wallets and displays wallet information, including the balance and network.

## Features

- Connects to Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask)
- Displays wallet address, balance, and network id (i tried my best to convert it to name)
- Shows a random avatar for fun
- input an address and get it's balance

## Setup

This project was created using the `@collinsadi/tailwind-setup` npm package, which streamlines the Tailwind CSS setup process in React environments. You can check out the package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collinsadi/tailwind-setup) to see how it can expedite your Tailwind CSS projects.

If you prefer to configure Tailwind manually or make customizations, Tailwind CSS is already integrated, so you're all set!
